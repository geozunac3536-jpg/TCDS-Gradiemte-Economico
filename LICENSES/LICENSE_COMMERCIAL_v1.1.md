## 1. Scope  
This license governs the design, replication, and improvement of **ΣFET (Sigma Field-Effect Transistor)** or any coherence-meter derived from TCDS-Σ specifications.

The objective is to maintain **open reproducibility** of the Σ-field detection principle while allowing certified developers to commercialize physical units.

---

## 2. Rights Granted  
Licensees may:
- Reproduce, assemble, and test ΣFET prototypes.  
- Integrate the device into measurement platforms or instrumentation systems.  
- Publish data obtained through ΣFET devices under open or commercial use.  
- Manufacture limited production runs (≤ 200 units/year) for R&D or demonstration.

---

## 3. Obligations  

1. **Attribution**  
   Cite the hardware design as:  
   *Carrasco Ozuna, G. (2025). ΣFET Coherencímetro — TCDS-Σ Hardware License v1.0.*

2. **Design Transparency**  
   - Keep schematic, BOM, and firmware source accessible (GitHub or equivalent).  
   - Include Σ-metrics in testing reports: LI ≥ 0.90, R > 0.95, RMSE < 0.10, reproducibility ≥ 95 %.  

3. **Registration**  
   - Record each produced unit (serial number, date, buyer) in `/economics/ledger.json`.  
   - Reference the Open Lab v1.1 license ID associated with the production.  

4. **Safety and Compliance**  
   - Follow international electrical safety standards (IEC 61010).  
   - No deployment for weaponized or surveillance applications.  

---

## 4. Commercialization  
- Manufacturing beyond 200 units/year requires a **Corporate Open Lab v1.1** license.  
- Sales must include a digital copy of this license and a ledger hash entry.  

---

## 5. Jurisdiction and Validity  
- Governed by Mexican and international IP law.  
- Non-exclusive, worldwide rights for R&D and educational use.  

---

## 6. Version History  
- **v1.0 (2025-11-01)** — initial public release synchronized with TCDS Open Lab v1.1.
